# Status (updated 2026-10-17, evening)

Read first. Kept short: what is in flight and what is next. Rewrite it in the same commit
as each step (conventions.md). Durable facts per area: [areas/sim.md](areas/sim.md),
[areas/ui.md](areas/ui.md), [areas/ai.md](areas/ai.md); read only the one you work in.
Rules: [conventions.md](conventions.md). Tools: [tools.md](tools.md). Old log:
[history.md](history.md) (don't read by default).

## Goal

Faithful Rust port of StarCraft: Brood War 1.16.1 (~all 4,644 functions, frame-exact; own
networking; no editor). Assets come from the user's install (`SCBW_INSTALL`).
Last step (after the port): optional StarCraft: Remastered assets read from the user's
SC:R install (CASC reader, HD `.anim` sprites / tiles / UI skin / audio, an RGBA
renderer at 2x/4x); the 8-bit 1.16.1 renderer stays the default and the test reference.

## Metric (the user watches this)

`python3 -I re/coverage.py agent/local/scratch/dump/bw116n.c .` "reachable from both":
2026-10-17 (after the coverage fix below): no AI 1140/1615 (70%), AI only 350/358 (97%),
all 1490/1973 (75%); front end 683/1186. Frontier lists: `--missing both` (non-AI),
`--missing ai`, `--missing front`. The "left" column is what is still to port.
Coverage fix 2026-10-17: a `///` line that only mentions an address in prose no longer
counts; only a doc block's first line or a doc line starting with `/// 0x...` does
(~90 false credits removed).

## Current direction (user, 2026-10-17)

AI unpaused: port the AI ("reachable from front end (AI only)" done 2026-10-17).
No screenshot tests unless working on UI. Small units, status updated with each commit.
Delegate per agents.md: Haiku triage, Sonnet porting, Opus review / hard RE / commits.

## In flight

- 2026-10-17 session (subagent waves: Haiku triage, Sonnet porters per file, Opus
  review): AI "left" 126 -> 0 and front end 32 -> 0 under the old count. Ported: AI
  script opcodes (all of 0x45b850 but 0x3b = 0x4355c0), attack planning ai_attack.rs
  (0x43abb0, 0x43b0b0, 0x43b570, 0x43e050), region / guard / defense requests
  (ai_military.rs 0x43f990, 0x4630c0, 0x43ebb0), building spots 0x443ac0 / 0x4442e0 /
  0x4448d0 / 0x440420, building-round helpers (ai_town.rs: 0x4361a0 / 0x435f10 /
  0x4348c0 / 0x4a2450 callees, 0x445aa0, 0x43a8f0, 0x43aae0), military step 0x43d910,
  attack timers 0x43b9e0, medic 0x436ae0, stim 0x43ffd0, worker bonus 0x447a70,
  ComputerReturn 0x478490; glue: campaign select / start / lookup chain, load screen,
  ready rooms, login / create / score open-close (event procs todo), 0x6d1220 is
  network.tbl; unit names from the map's STR (0x47b090), "unit unplaceable" line
  0x48d140. Review fixes: 0x4a2450 arbiter returns 1; 0x4a2130 calls 0x432760.
- In progress: the ~40 functions the coverage fix exposed (inline equivalents to
  extract, UI plumbing to bucket, 0x43cd40 random target, 0x4d8df0 credits screen).
- AI todo_port! left: 0x43cd40, 0x476fc0 / 0x43d5d0 siege tank parts, 0x4355c0 (opcode
  0x3b), 0x434c90 non-town-AI branches, 0x404500, 0x435700 / 0x435770 / 0x435db0 parent
  cases (grep `todo_port!("0x4` in src/bw/ai*.rs attack.rs).
- Glue left: dialog event procs (ready rooms 0x4f7150 / 0x4f74b0 / 0x4f7810, login
  0x4edaa0, create 0x4af5c0, score 0x4b4a30), mission list 0x4b7820, 0x4a8590, error
  popup 0x4bb300, OK/Cancel 0x4b5b20 (taken as OK; campaigns can't start yet anyway).
- Don't commit README.md, .gitignore, web/*, cov.html (user's own work).

## Next steps

1. Finish the coverage-fix list, then the AI todo_port! list above (0x43cd40 first).
2. Glue event procs, so the ready rooms / login / create / score dialogs work.
3. Unported non-AI frontier (`--missing both`), triage then port.
4. Run tl1341 / 1349 / 1354 / 1356 replays on the current binary (areas/sim.md).
5. Workflow: porters on disjoint files run in parallel fine (shared target dir; they
   retry when another's file breaks the build). Stage the verified tree (`git add`)
   before starting the next wave, commit the index after the verifier passes.

## Always

- Background runs (suite, repcmp, native captures) with a copied binary
  (`SCBW=$W/x agent/tools/suite.sh`); build to `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=agent/local/tgt`.
- Before commit: build clean, suite has no non-MATCH lines.
